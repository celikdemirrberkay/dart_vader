## Features

Instead of writing the same codes over and over again for a long time, access them practically through context.

## Getting started

```yaml
dependencies:
  vader: <latest_version>
```


## Samples

```dart
bool isIOS = context.isIOS;
```

```dart
Text(
    'You would be wise to surrender',
    style: context.bodyLarge //Instead of Theme.of(context).bodyLarge
);
```
